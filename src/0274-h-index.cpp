/*
Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of
citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper, return _the researcher
's h-index_.

According to the [definition of h-index on
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): The h-index is defined as
the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least
`h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

 **Example 1:**



     **Input:** citations = [3,0,6,1,5] **Output:** 3 **Explanation:**
[3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.Since the researcher has 3 papers
with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3
citations each, their h-index is 3.

 **Example 2:**



     **Input:** citations = [1,3,1] **Output:** 1

 **Constraints:**

  * `n == citations.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 5000`
  * `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`
